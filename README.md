# DAY 1

In todays session we just got familiar with what this course is all about , syllabus etc.

We learned in brief about taking input and giving output in a C program.

For giving output we use **printf()**

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()             
{       
	printf("Hello World\n");
	return 0;
}
```

For taking input from the user we use **scanf()**

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()             
{
	 int a,b;
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
	 printf("\n"); 	 
	 printf("a=%d\tb=%d\n",a,b);
	 return 0;
}
```
